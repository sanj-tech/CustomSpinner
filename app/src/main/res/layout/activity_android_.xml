      Android is an open source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, and other companies.
      Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by Android.

    The first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released by Google in 2007 where as the first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008.
Application Framework
The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.

The Android framework includes the following key services −

Activity Manager − Controls all aspects of the application lifecycle and activity stack.

Content Providers − Allows applications to publish and share data with other applications.

Resource Manager − Provides access to non-code embedded resources such as strings, color settings and user interface layouts.

Notifications Manager − Allows applications to display alerts and notifications to the user.

View System − An extensible set of views used to create application user interfaces."
